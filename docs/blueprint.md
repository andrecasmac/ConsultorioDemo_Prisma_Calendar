# **App Name**: Consultorio

## Core Features:

- Secure Login: Secure login using credentials.
- Patient Creation Form: Form to create new patients with fields for name and date of birth.
- Patient Search: Searchable list to find patients.
- Patient Details and Visits: A patient view shows their basic information, including a datagrid to show their past visit notes.
- Visit Note Generator: An AI powered summarization tool that produces a note from the list of symptoms and the prescription. This feature should be easy to remove from the application code, in case it does not work as expected.
- Add New Visit Form: A form inside each patient's view allows for the addition of new visit details (date, symptoms, prescription).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Subtle blue (#75A9D9) to inspire calm and confidence.
- Background color: Light gray (#F2F4F7) to offer a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted green (#90EE90) to indicate health.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a sans-serif offering a modern but still welcoming appearance
- Use universally recognizable and clear icons for navigation and actions, such as a plus sign for 'add new visit,' or a pencil icon for 'edit.'
- Maintain a clean, well-spaced layout to avoid overwhelming users with information. Use containers and cards to group related content. Align elements for a neat, orderly appearance.
- Use subtle transitions on interactions like hovering or form submissions to give feedback without being distracting. Avoid animations for purely decorative purposes.
